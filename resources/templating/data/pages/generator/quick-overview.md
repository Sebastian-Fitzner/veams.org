### NodeJS

Just install [NodeJS from their website](http://nodejs.org) and be sure it is in your environment path. You can check it in your console:

``` bash
node -v
```

### Yeoman

Install Yeoman with the following command:

``` bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Grunt

Install Grunt (or to be more specific Grunt-CLI) with:

``` bash
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

### Bower

Install Bower with the following command:

``` bash
npm install -g bower
```

### PG
Now install our pretty neat PG:

``` bash
npm install -g generator-prototype
```

If you want to update PG you can do the following:

``` bash
npm update -g generator-prototype
```

Now we have installed all important tools to work with the standard features of PG.

**Do you want to use Compass and SASS/SCSS instead of Libsass?**
Then you need to make sure you have Ruby, Compass and SASS/SCSS installed.
