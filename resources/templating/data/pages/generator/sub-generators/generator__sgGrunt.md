### Grunt-Plugins
This Sub-Generator gives you the possibility to scaffold a general task file which will be placed in your _helpers/_grunt_ folder.
Just install them with:

``` bash
yo veams:grunt
```

### Example
You want to add another grunt module like `grunt-image-size-export`. Just execute `yo veams:grunt` and choose your grunt-plugin. Press `Enter` and the task file will be placed in your *_grunt* folder. All dependencies will be automatically installed.

If you want to add the task to your `build` process, just modify your Gruntfile.js. That's it!
