### Assemble Plugins

In the installation routine you can choose specific modules for Assemble:

 * assemble-contrib-permalinks
 * assemble-contrib-sitemap
 * assemble-related-pages

### Extended Layouts

Assemble comes with another pretty nice helper to solve problems with complexity in layouts. This helpers are `\{{#block}}`,`\{{#extend}}` and `\{{#content}}` and makes it easy for us to extend specific sections in your layout. 

We suggest you to add this in the prompts.
