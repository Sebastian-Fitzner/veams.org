### General

In the most general sense Veams provided very useful Sass frameworks:

1. Foundation
2. Bootstrap Sass
3. Bourbon (Neat)

The purpose of Veams-Sass is not to replace any of the frameworks above rather than extend them. 

### Background

Personally I really like [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/), but not all of Bourbon is needed, other things are missing because they are too specific or a few things have to be modified. 

That's why I decided to create a simple and lightweight library which contains specific enhancements like animation sets or icon mixins.
 
In the end my personal favor is to use both libraries (Bourbon with Bourbon Neat and Veams-Sass).

### What can you expect?

1. Browser resets (Reset.css or Normalize.css and further custom resets)
2. Layout mixins 
3. Animation sets (over 90 presets)
4. Helper mixins
