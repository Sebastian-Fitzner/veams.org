### How to use

Just copy and paste the files you need to your project. 

### Main Files

#### `components`

Here you can find general components. Just copy and paste the files you need into your project (`resources/templating/partials/components`). 

1. Each component has a data (JSON) and style (SCSS) file in the same folder. 
2. The `JSON` file is your blueprint.
3. The Sass file should be included.

#### `wrap-with`

In the `wrap-with` folder you can find partials which can be used to wrap other content. 
These partials can be used to wrap components and modules and structure your code base. 

Just copy and paste a `wrap-with` into `resources/templating/partials/wrap-with`.. 

#### `markdown`

I created some markdown files to speed up the integration of dummy content. 

Just choose the files you need from the `markdown` folder.
