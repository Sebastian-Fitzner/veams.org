### What is PG?

PG is a Generator based on [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/). If you don't want to use PG give another Generator just a try. To cut the matter short:
* PG helps you to kickstart new and complex projects in a few minutes.
* PG uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) as Task Runner.
* PG uses [Bower](http://bower.io/) as Web Package Manager.
* Pg uses [Assemble](http://assemble.io/) as Template Engine.

### Need more points why to use it?

PG is build to speed up your workflow and keep it performant. It comes with further sub-generators which you can use in current projects:
* Install new Grunt modules in your working project.
* Add custom Assemble Helper files.
* Scaffold BackboneJS Views, Models and Collections.
