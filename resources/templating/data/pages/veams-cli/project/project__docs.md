### JavaScript Documentation

JSDoc 3 is an API documentation generator for JavaScript, similar to JavaDoc or PHPDoc. You add documentation comments directly to your source code, right along side the code itself. The JSDoc Tool will scan your source code, and generate a complete HTML documentation website for you. 

Veams uses [grunt-jsdoc](https://github.com/krampstudio/grunt-jsdoc) or [gulp-jsdoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-jsdoc).

### Sass Documentation (currently in development)

SassDoc is to Sass what JSDoc is to JavaScript: a documentation system to build pretty and powerful docs in the blink of an eye. 

Veams uses [grunt-sassdoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-sassdoc) or [sassdoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sassdoc).

### HTML Documentation (currently in development)

You can also add a documentation for your HTML Components. Therefore Veams uses HandlebarsJS and HighlightJS.
