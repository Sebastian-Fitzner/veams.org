### Mangony 

Mangony is a yet another static site generator - fast, simple and powerful. 

Mangony fulfills just one task: It takes handlebars templates and compiles them to an output directory.

Mangony is [feature-rich](https://github.com/Sebastian-Fitzner/mangony#features) and a scalable standalone solution.

### Extended Layouts

Assemble and Mangony ship with another pretty nice helper to solve problems with complexity in layouts. These helpers are `\{{#block}}`,`\{{#extend}}` and `\{{#content}}` and makes it easy for us to extend specific sections in your layout (for more information see: https://github.com/shannonmoeller/handlebars-layouts).

We suggest you to add this in the prompts for Assemble. In Mangony it the standard layouting procedure.
