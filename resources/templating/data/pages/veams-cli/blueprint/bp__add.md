One of the major benefits of Veams-cli is that you can easily create components or blocks and insert all files and snippets automatically to your project. 

You can start to add a new component or block with:

``` bash
veams add component [name]
```
or 
``` bash
veams add block [name]
```

That's it! Just take a look into your project structure ...
