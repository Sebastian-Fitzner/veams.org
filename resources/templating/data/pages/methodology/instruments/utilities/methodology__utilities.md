### General

On most applications we have markup which has no relationship to its content but is important to display the inner HTML in a structured way. Nice examples are grid helper classes like Foundation or Boostrap provides. 

Therefore Veams uses the instrument `Utility` and provides a neat [handlebars helper](/veams-cli/template-helper/overview.html#wrapwith-helper-block-helper-).
 
Examples are:

1. Grid systems per class
2. Multiple sections in regions

You do not have to use Utilities when you think it is not necessary - this is up to you.  

### Why do we use Utilities?

We use Utilities to simplify the differentiation between `Components` and helper markup.

### Structure

When we use Utilities, we prefix them with `u-` (or `_u-` for scss files). The declaration helps us structuring our code base. 

But you can also just forget the prefix when you are using frameworks with predefined classes.

#### Example Snippet

``` hbs
<div class="u-grid-row">
    <div class="u-grid-col is-3">
    </div>
    <div class="u-grid-col is-3">
    </div>
    <div class="u-grid-col is-3">
    </div>
</div>
```

### File/Folder Structure

When you use a Template Engine, it is important to create a folder for your utilities. 

Our utilities folder structure can look like this: 

``` bash
    └───partials
        └───utilities
               u-grid-row.hbs
               u-grid-col.hbs
               u-section.hbs

```

### Styles and Sass Structure

The styles are scoped to the utility. 

For each Utility we create a Sass file. The folder can look like this: 

``` bash
├───scss
	└───utilities
			_u-grid-row.scss
			_u-grid-col.scss
			_u-section.scss
```

### Examples

Here are some examples: 

* Grid System
* Sections

#### Grid Row

``` hbs
<div class="u-grid-row">
\{{{yield}}}
</div>
```

#### Grid Column

``` hbs
<div class="u-grid-col\{{#if options.classes}} \{{options.classes}}\{{/if}}">
\{{{yield}}}
</div>
```
