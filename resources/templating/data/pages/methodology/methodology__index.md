### Why another methodology?

There are many frontend methodologies out there. And I like a few of them. But I don't feel comfortable with them at all. 

**Most methodologies are scoped to `html` and `css`. To be more specific, these methodologies are only handling `class systems`. But I think that is not enough.** 

So I decide to go my own way of structuring projects. 

I am not reinventing the wheel. I just take out some pieces from BEM, take some parts from my backend experience in Drupal and frontend experience in various projects and get important exchange through the close dialogue with other developers. 

### What is the difference?

`Veams-Methodology` is a system for your whole frontend stack. Typical questions - which `Veams-Methodology` is solving - are: 

1. How to scope and differentiate units (`components`, `blocks`, `regions`) in your `HTML`?
2. How to bind JavaScript to your DOM elements?
3. How to structure layouts?
4. How to write your classes?
5. How to extend your project?
